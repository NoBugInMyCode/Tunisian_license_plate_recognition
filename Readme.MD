# Tunisian license plate recognition
Use two datasets to build a machine learning model that can recognize Tunisian licence plate

## Project overview
#### This project can divide into 4 steps
1. Build a machine learning model(CNN) that can recognize digit numbers from 0 to 9, and a special Tunisian letter in the middle of the licence plate
2. Use .xml file from dataset to locate the licence plate from pictures
3. Split licence plate into different chunks and each chunk has one digit or one Tunisian letter
4. Apply trained ML model on to those letters and output the licence plate

## Dataset
